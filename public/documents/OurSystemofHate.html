The result of which is a significant increase in the frequency of Coalition ground troops receiving direct small arms fires through ambushes. To combat this, a new strategy of having helicopters provide security to ground troops and their convoys was devised and put into standard practice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The day is July 12th, 2007, it&rsquo;s noon in Al-Amin al-Thaniyah, New Baghdad. Reuters journalists, Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh, were interviewing the civilians attempting to live in the area.<br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">While Saeed answered a call on his cellphone, Namir took a photo of a humvee nearby around the corner of a residential building. Namir and the crowd of locals surrounding him turn from the corner to continue down their path, but then dirt starts shooting up from the ground beneath them. In an instant, the men all scatter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">At least 1200 meters away and 1000 meters up, two American AH-64 Apache helicopters are requesting permission to fire upon a group of men gathered on a main road with AK-47s and an RPG. The pilots are given the go ahead to fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Chmagh is fatally wounded, but manages to leap out of the way of direct incoming fire. Multiple locals are lost, completely engulfed by the smoke-like dust produced by the attack helicopter&rsquo;s 30mm round. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A projectile as long as a man&rsquo;s forearm. The round is designed as an anti-material munition. Completely overkill for personnel, but with the Iraqi army of Saddam having long been dissolved, there isn&rsquo;t much armor to contend with from a far weaker insurgent force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Namir sprints off and out of the helicopter&#39;s direct fire, but falls not moments later. Separated from the killzone, but still alive, the Apache gunner singles out Namir. Namir is then bifurcated from the waist down. His foot is the last the world sees of him, flung high in the air as the gunner scans off to engage further targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Later that night the Department of Defense (DoD) reported, &ldquo;Firefight in New Baghdad.

It wasn&rsquo;t until 3 years later, when the full length video was leaked by Chelsea Manning, and reported on by Wikileaks, that the world learned of </span><span class="c4"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/1248069533084/collateral-murder.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1665513014562058&amp;usg=AOvVaw098VgnkMKOYxQYH7F4OOJg">what truly transpired</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">The leaked video from the Apache helicopters, WikiLeaks titled, &ldquo;Collateral Murder,&rdquo; included audio of the orders, requests, and statements relayed back and forth between the 4 pilots, and their operating base.

However, to people critical of the American state, this reveal only presented further questions. &nbsp;The reasons, some, including myself, argue that this murder and coverup was uncovered was because of a whistleblower that knew where to look, and because of who two of the victims were. Would reactions have been different if the victims were only locals? How many similar events have occurred over our 20 years of the war on terror, the victims smeared as &ldquo;insurgents&rdquo; killed in a &ldquo;firefight,&rdquo; or written off as collateral damage?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Not a single article mentioned the other men in the crowd killed that day. Not a single article cared to even report their names. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The media is and has always been a powerful tool. Which makes sense. The media is the delivery force of information, and information is the most effective mobilizing force when it&rsquo;s openly available, and the most effective method of sedation when it&rsquo;s taken away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Before the information age, a leak like the one Manning provided WikiLeaks might not have been as reachable to the public, as its reachability and ability to remain a relevant story was limited to the popularity of the platform it&#39;s published on. And With big name news agencies having policies in which they first check with government officials to ask if they would, in effect, </span><span class="c4"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/reader-center/how-the-times-decides-when-to-publish-leaked-news.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1665513014563290&amp;usg=AOvVaw3CN-9qAHEI2WmzWElI8Oed">sign off on the publishing</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of the leaked information, there was no guarantee that the public would be properly informed whenever there is damning information involving their government. Social media changed all of that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Social media made it possible for anyone to set a narrative, and have it compete with the general consensus, whether it&rsquo;s valid or not. Social media has revolutionized the way news can be distributed, as it has allowed independently funded agencies to publish, grow an audience, and self-fund themselves. However, social media, we are seeing, doesn&rsquo;t just level the playing field between legacy and new media. It also can, and most certainly has, granted extremist propaganda an air of legitimacy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">So, in effect, social media is not truly a new form of media. I would best describe social media as an amplifier of our traditional media tools. This fact has been displayed adequately with the Russo-Ukraine war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">There are rare moments in life where you are given the opportunity to discover the truth of something you might have at one point in time thought unimaginable. For me, I always wondered how institutions and the general public would respond if the roles of modern warfare were reversed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">How would we react to a European country being invaded by a larger military force similar to the actions we&rsquo;ve justified in our recent history? How would Europe respond to this new group of war refugees enacting their rights to asylum, as opposed to their response to the last? How would the public tolerate imagery of the brutality inherent to war? Would they take those horrific scenes in stride? Just as they&rsquo;ve done so in the past. Or would they be driven to demand retaliation? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">All of these questions were answered within the short 2 months directly following the invasion of Ukraine conducted by the Russian military.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Once Russia started its invasion of Ukraine, February 24th, 2022, the western nations moved almost entirely in sync with one another to shift focus and resources towards boosting Ukraine&rsquo;s military capabilities, while at the same time attempting to limit The Russian Federation&rsquo;s financial capabilities. The western media turned up the gas, doing their best to drown out any attempt from Russia to spread propaganda by instead repeating propaganda spread by the Ukrainian government preparing for a siege in Kyiv. And the everyday people of Europe, and the North Americas in particular, joined in an effort to help prepare and receive the inevitable arrival of Ukrainian refugees. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The quick unification of nation-states to join in opposing Russia, and denouncing the Russian government&rsquo;s actions, as well as the level of solidarity demonstrated by citizens to aid their fellow man although strangers from foreign countries half the world away, was truly awe inspiring to witness. However, almost immediately an obvious &lsquo;double standard&rsquo; started to become exposed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Everyone noticed it. People were asking questions about it. It&rsquo;s just that no one was willing to address it.
